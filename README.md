# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Yield Prediction

This project aims to predict crop yields using various environmental and agricultural data. The goal is to develop a model that can help farmers and stakeholders make informed decisions about crop production, resource allocation, and food security.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

### Objectives
- **Develop a predictive model**: Build a machine learning model to estimate crop yields based on features like temprature,annual rain fall and pesticide usage.
- **Data Exploration**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors influencing crop yields.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare different models to find the best approach for accurate predictions.

### Dataset
- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset
- **Features**: Include features such as temperature, rainfall, soil pH, pesticide usage.

### Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or selecting important ones for the model.
- **Modeling**: Applying various regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination) to evaluate the models.

### Future Work
- **Model Deployment**: Plan to deploy the model using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Explore neural networks or other advanced models to improve accuracy.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration.
